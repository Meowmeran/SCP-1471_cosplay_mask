### Additional props to create to give the SCP-1471 impression:
- SCP-207, simple as bringing a bottle of coca-cola.
- Keycard
- SCP-420-J; wrap a piece of paper, burn the tip a little bit and put the fire out immediately.
- Class-D Plushie
- A SPEAKER, play various sound effects or even musics during your cosplay, as quiet as possible but don't make it inhearable
